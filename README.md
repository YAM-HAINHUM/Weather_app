# Weather_app
This is a basic Weather App built using Python. It fetches real-time weather data for a given city using an API like OpenWeatherMap and displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The app can be implemented as a simple command-line tool or enhanced with a GUI for better user experience.
